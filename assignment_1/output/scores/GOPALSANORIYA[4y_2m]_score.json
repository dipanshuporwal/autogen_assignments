    "The skills section reflects strong alignment with many key requirements such as LLM, LangChain, Hugging Face, NLP frameworks, and cloud computing platforms.",
    "Experience is relevant but falls short of the required 7\u201310 years and lacks specific experience in advanced tools like certain vector databases.",
    "Education aligns with the requirement, but the job description lists MS as preferred, which might be a minor gap.",
    "Certifications could strengthen the candidate's profile further, even though none are listed specifically in the job description as required.",
    "Language and communication skills are sufficient but could be enhanced with a well-crafted professional summary.",
    "Overall, the resume presentation is adequate but could benefit from restructuring to emphasize relevance to key job requirements."
